Uploader by pyther <pyther@pyther.net>

Uploader was created because I needed a simple platform to allow users to upload files
to my web server. Uploader allows you to create users, set upload credit limits, and user 
expiration dates.

There is an Administration control panel to manage the users.

Installation:
    -Configure webserver correctly to use script
    -Create Sqlite Database:
        create table sessions (
            session_id char(128) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            atime timestamp NOT NULL default current_timestamp,
            data text
        );
        create table users (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(20),
            password VARCHAR(20),
            credits INTEGER,
            exprdate DATETIME,
            usertype BOOLEAN 
        );

        or copy the example.db (username: admin, password: admin)

File bugs, feature requests, or anything else on the github page.
